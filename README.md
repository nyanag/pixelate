# Pixelate
An experiment with openCV, inspired by Spreadsheet art

# Inspiration
One afternoon I stumbled across this video on [Spreadsheet Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I) and was inspired to do something similar. 
I am primarily JS developer, so I thought it would be challenging to build something using OpenCV!
I had some help from StackOverFlow :)
